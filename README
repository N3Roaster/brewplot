BrewPlot is an electronic coffee brewing control chart. You enter the weight of
the coffee grounds before brewing them, the weight of the brewed coffee, and
the percent total dissolved solids as read from a coffee refractometer, TDS
meter, or other method of measurement. BrewPlot takes this information to
calculate the extraction yield of the brewed coffee and plots this and the
strength of the coffee in a chart that you can use to help adjust your brewing
parameters to make better tasting coffee.

BrewPlot was originally written as an exercise in learning how to use QML.
